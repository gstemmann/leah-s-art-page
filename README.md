### **Tools Used**

This application makes use of the Strapi Headless CMS for User Administration and general site maintenance. The front end utilizes React.js library and makes API requests to endpoints set up with Strapi. The site also utilizes Amazon Web Service to maintain photos live in production.

Other Tools

- Postgresql
- Heroku
- React-Bootstrap
- Axios
- PGAdmin
- AWS S3

---

### **User Flow**

The site comes with an admin dashboard that is completely hidden from users unless the admin priveleges are given and authenitcated. The admin dashboard is fully functional with photo upload functionality with photos hosted on AWS S3. The admin can also easily assign roles to other users to allow create, read, update and delete website components. The entire database is in production hosted on heroku using Postgresql. 






# Getting Started with Create React App 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
